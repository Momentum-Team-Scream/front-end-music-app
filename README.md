# NoteJam

NoteJam is a two-user app that connects private music teachers and their students.

Teachers can make lesson plans, send assignment notes to students, and upload and share sheet music.

Students can see their assignments, make practice logs, and download sheet music their instructor shares with them.

This repo houses the frontend of the app, built using React and Bootstrap. NoteJam makes use of API endpoints to send and request data from the backend. [View the backend repo here.](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-Scream/backend-music-app)
